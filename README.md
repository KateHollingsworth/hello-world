# hello-world
GitHub told me to do it

I call myself Kate. Other people also call me this because that's usually how names work.
Many years ago I used to program in PASCAL and Basic, and went to highschool programming competitions. That name was great:
Computer Science League ALL-STARS Competitions!
Now I do other things, but I have a desire to code again.
